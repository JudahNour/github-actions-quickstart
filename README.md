# github-actions-quickstart
Done for Homework 2 of Cis 3500

## Documentation Feedback:

The documentation was quite clear. As a student who was trying to quickly set up a GitHub action this was a very quick guide which was straight to the point with the information that I needed. 

Personally, I did find myself unsure what exactly I was doing (or why I was doing it) which I did think was not the best. However, as a quick start guide, I imagine that it makes sense not to go into the details of what is actually going on, as opposed to just quickly providing the guide. I would personally prefer slightly more context (like what even is a GitHub action in the first place or what the GitHub action we are creating is doing), but again I don't know if that would really fit in with the page
